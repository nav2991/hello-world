First repository created by Navjot
# hello
Repository used to understand how github works :)

I have created a branch which extends from main, this change is used to see the
effects it has on the repository which I will be committing, and then opening and merging a pull request.
Here is some quick code i've written..

print("Hello this is Navjot")
